    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To give people information on our white water rafting tours. We are availabe to allow people to book appointments, view 
        previous rafting trips, and become informed about our company. Our goal is to persuade visitors to choose our company 
        for white water rafting over other companies out there. We will do this by displaying a gallery of the average white
        water rafting tour, showcasing our amazing employees, and explaining why we are the best option.
